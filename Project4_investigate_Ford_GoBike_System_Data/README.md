investigate Ford GoBike System Data

1) Dataset:
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. I will explore the dataset to understand the relationships for all data in order, which is gathering cleaning as the Wrangling part then there will be exploration as uni, bi and multi explorations to understand this dataset more, And this the most important columns for the dataset:

* duration_sec: which has the duration of the trip has been spent in seconds from this column, I did extract two more columns which is the duration in minutes by dividing the columns of duration in seconds by 60 then after that I divided the columns of durations in minutes by 60 to have new columns which is the duration in hours.

* start_time: this is also one of the most important columns which contain the year, month, day, hour, minutes, and seconds, and from this, I managed to extract the start months, 24 hours of the day and weekdays.

* user_type: there are two types of user types which are subscribers and customers.

* member birth year: this column, records the birthday of the members, and from this column, it has been extracted the age of the member.

* member_gender: this column contains the member genders which are male, female, and others.

* bike share for all trips: this column is a boolean type with yes or no if the members share the bike for all the trips.




2) Summary of Findings:

I explored the dataset to understand the relationships for all data in order, which is gathering, cleaning, and assessing as the wrangling part, I managed to add a lot of columns that have extracted like member age from the member date of birth and from duration in second I managed to add more columns like duration in hours and in minutes also from the start date I managed to extract the month which was later all data at the same month also the start day of weeks and the start hours of the day. After this was the univariate exploration part which is to explore the relationship for one column which was rich knowledge and helpful for the next parts. Then the Bivariate exploration part is the part where you find the relationship between two columns which is the part that I worked on the most because it's a really important part. For last there was the multivariate part which is the part where I explore the relationship between more than one or two, for this part the relationship was clear and it was making sense because of the previous part and that comes to me that all of these parts of exploration are important to make everything clear for the next part of the exploration.




3) Key Insights for Presentation:

Different usage of plots to describe and to give findings of the data, describe relationships between different variables and how they relate to each other. male subscribers between the age of 25 till 34 are the most of the members also they're the most spent duration of time and most of the members prefer not to share bike for all the trip even though the users like to use the service between the time 7-9 in the morning and 16-18 in the evening during the weekdays and less for the weekends which prefer that most of the users use the service for work purpose.
